## Deferred Features

These features are removed/deferred until MVP is validated:

- ❌ 13 Orchestrators → 1 (Removed 12)
- ❌ 14 DNA Systems → 0 (Removed all)
- ❌ "Consciousness" AI (Not realistic)
- ❌ "God Mode" features (Marketing hype)
- ❌ 100% accuracy claims (Not achievable)

**Rationale**: Focus on core business value, ship MVP, iterate based on user feedback.
