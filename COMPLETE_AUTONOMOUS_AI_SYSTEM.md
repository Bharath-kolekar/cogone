## 🚀 Autonomous Operation

### What It Can Do Autonomously

```
✅ Generate its own code
✅ Modify its own code
✅ Detect its own bugs
✅ Fix its own bugs
✅ Generate its own tests
✅ Run its own tests
✅ Monitor its own health
✅ Repair its own issues
✅ Validate its own code
✅ Check its own health
✅ Correct its own issues
✅ Monitor itself continuously
```

### What Requires Human Intervention

```
⚠️ Applying HIGH_RISK modifications

```

**Autonomy Level**: **95%+ (only critical decisions need approval)**

## 💡 Complete Workflow Example

```python
import httpx

token = "your_auth_token"
base_url = "http://localhost:8000/api/v0/self-modification"

# 1. Start continuous monitoring
httpx.post(f"{base_url}/monitoring/start", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
print("✅ Continuous monitoring started")

# System now runs autonomously:
# - Validates itself every 5 minutes
# - Checks its own health
# - Detects issues
# - Corrects issues automatically
# - All without human intervention!

# 2. Check what it's doing
import time
time.sleep(600)  # Wait 10 minutes

stats = httpx.get(
    f"{base_url}/monitoring/stats",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
).json()

print(f"\n📊 What the AI did autonomously:")
print(f"  Checks performed: {stats['stats']['checks_performed']}")
print(f"  Issues found: {stats['stats']['issues_found']}")
print(f"  Auto-corrected: {stats['stats']['corrections_applied']}")

# 3. Run manual full self-check
check = httpx.post(
    f"{base_url}/full-self-check",
    json={"component": None},
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
).json()

print(f"\n🔍 Full Self-Check Results:")
print(f"  Overall Score: {check['overall_score']}/100")
print(f"  Status: {check['status'].upper()}")
print(f"  Validation Score: {check['validation']['score']}/100")
print(f"  Health Score: {check['health']['overall_score']}/100")

# 4. Generate new code
code_gen = httpx.post(
    f"{base_url}/code/generate",
    json={
        "specification": "Create a function to calculate Fibonacci",
        "file_path": "utils/math_utils.py"
    },
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
).json()

print(f"\n🔧 Code Generation:")
print(f"  Safety Level: {code_gen['validation']['safety_level']}")
print(f"  Can Apply: {code_gen['can_apply']}")

# 5. System validates and corrects itself automatically!
```
