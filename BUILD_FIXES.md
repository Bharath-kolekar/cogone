# Build Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the build fixes applied to resolve compilation issues during the project build process.

## Frontend Build Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Issues
**Problem**: Components were importing `use-toast` from incorrect paths.

**Files Fixed**:
- `frontend/app/auth/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/settings/page.tsx` 
- `frontend/components/TwoFactorLogin.tsx`
- `frontend/components/TwoFactorSettings.tsx`
- `frontend/components/TwoFactorSetup.tsx`

**Solution**: Changed imports from `'./ui/use-toast'` to `'../hooks/use-toast'` (correct path)

```diff
- import { toast } from './ui/use-toast';
+ import { toast } from '../hooks/use-toast';
```

### 2. Next.js Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Invalid `env.CUSTOM_KEY` configuration in `next.config.js`

**File**: `frontend/next.config.js`

**Solution**: Removed the problematic env configuration block

```diff
- env: {
-   CUSTOM_KEY: process.env.CUSTOM_KEY,
- },
```

### 3. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Missing `jotai` and `next-themes` packages

**Solution**: Installed missing dependencies
```bash
npm install jotai next-themes
```

### 4. TypeScript State Typing Issue
**Problem**: `generatedApp` state was typed as `null` but being set to an object

**File**: `frontend/components/hero.tsx`

**Solution**: Added proper type definition for the state

```typescript
const [generatedApp, setGeneratedApp] = useState<{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  preview_url: string;
  status: string;
} | null>(null)
```

### 5. SpeechRecognition API Type Issue
**Problem**: TypeScript error accessing `window.SpeechRecognition`

**File**: `frontend/components/voice-recorder.tsx`

**Solution**: Used proper type casting

```diff
- const recognition = new ((window.SpeechRecognition as any) || (window.webkitSpeechRecognition as any))()
+ const recognition = new ((window as any).SpeechRecognition || (window as any).webkitSpeechRecognition)()
```

## Backend Dependencies Fixed

### 1. Package Version Conflicts
**Problem**: Dependency conflicts between packages

**File**: `backend/requirements.txt`

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed `httpx` version conflict with supabase: `httpx>=0.24.0,<0.25.0`
- Removed non-existent packages:
  - `python-cors==1.7.0` (commented out)
  - `gzip-stream==0.1.0` (commented out) 
  - `zipfile38==0.0.3` (commented out)

### 2. Installation Success
**Result**: Backend dependencies installed successfully with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Outstanding Issues

### tRPC Configuration Issue
**Problem**: TypeScript errors with tRPC setup in `frontend/components/providers.tsx`

**Error Details**:
```
Property 'createClient' does not exist on type '"The property 'useContext' in your router collides with a built-in method, rename this router or procedure on your backend."'
Property 'Provider' does not exist on type '"The property 'useContext' in your router collides with a built-in method, rename this router or procedure on your backend."'
```

**Temporary Solution**: Removed tRPC from providers temporarily to unblock build

**Root Cause**: 
- AppRouter type definition issue in `frontend/lib/trpc.ts`
- Potential version mismatch between tRPC client/server
- Router naming conflicts with built-in methods

**Files Involved**:
- `frontend/lib/trpc.ts` - tRPC configuration
- `frontend/components/providers.tsx` - Provider setup
- `backend/app/routers/index.py` - Router definitions

**Next Steps Needed**:
1. Review backend router definitions for naming conflicts
2. Check tRPC version compatibility between frontend/backend
3. Fix AppRouter type exports
4. Re-enable tRPC in providers after fixes

## Build Status
- ✅ Backend dependencies: Installed successfully
- ✅ Frontend dependencies: Installed successfully  
- ✅ Frontend compilation: Mostly working (pending tRPC fix)
- ⚠️ tRPC integration: Temporarily disabled

## Commands Used
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install jotai next-themes
npm run build
```
