# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, email: security@cognomega.com (or your designated security contact)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours.

## Security Practices

### Current Status

ðŸŸ¡ **Security Audit Pending**

**Completed:**
- âœ… Pydantic validation in place
- âœ… JWT authentication framework
- âœ… Rate limiting middleware
- âœ… CORS configuration
- âœ… Environment variable management

**Pending:**
- ðŸ”œ Comprehensive security audit (Week 7)
- ðŸ”œ Penetration testing
- ðŸ”œ Dependency vulnerability scan
- ðŸ”œ SQL injection testing
- ðŸ”œ XSS testing

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Current Implementation

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based authentication
- TOTP 2FA support
- Session management
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) via Supabase
- API key authentication

### Best Practices
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Use strong hashing (bcrypt)
- Enforce 2FA for sensitive operations
- Rotate secrets regularly

---

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data
- Passwords: Hashed with bcrypt
- API keys: Encrypted at rest
- Payment data: Never stored (handled by providers)
- User data: Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

### Database Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Encrypted connections
- Regular backups
- Access logs maintained

---

## API Security

### Current Protections
- Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- CORS restrictions
- Input validation (Pydantic)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)

### Recommendations
- Use API keys for programmatic access
- Implement request signing for critical operations
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Log all authentication attempts

---

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Issue: 687 Endpoints
**Risk**: Large attack surface

**Mitigation Plan:**
- Reduce to 100 essential endpoints (see ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md)
- Add comprehensive endpoint monitoring
- Implement endpoint-specific rate limits

### Issue: Over-Complexity
**Risk**: More code = more vulnerabilities

**Mitigation Plan:**
- Consolidate 296 services â†’ 40
- Consolidate 118 routers â†’ 15
- Simplify codebase for easier security review

## Dependencies

### Vulnerability Scanning

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install safety
safety check

# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated
```

### Update Policy

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables set securely
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (no HTTP)
- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] Secrets rotated
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested

### Security Headers
```python
# Recommended headers (to be implemented)
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

---

## Compliance

### Current Status
- GDPR: Partial (needs review)
- CCPA: Not assessed
- SOC 2: Not certified
- PCI DSS: Not applicable (using payment providers)

### Planned Compliance
- Complete GDPR compliance review
- Implement data retention policies
- Add user data export/deletion
- Privacy policy updates

---

## Incident Response

### Procedure
1. **Detection**: Monitoring alerts or user report
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and scope
4. **Remediation**: Apply fixes
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Post-Mortem**: Document and improve
