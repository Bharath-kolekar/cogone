## 💡 BEST PRACTICES ESTABLISHED

### **Refactoring Approach:**

1. ✅ **Manual First**: Understand pattern, establish quality
2. ✅ **Automate Second**: Build script once pattern is clear
3. ✅ **Batch Third**: Process multiple files at once
4. ✅ **Test Always**: Verify after each extraction
5. ✅ **Quarantine Everything**: Safe rollback critical
6. ✅ **Preserve Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes

### **File Size Guidelines:**

- ✅ **Regular Modules**: <300 lines (ideal: 100-200)
- ✅ **Service Classes**: <500 lines
- ✅ **Orchestrators**: <2,000 lines (can be 1,000-1,500)
- ✅ **Routers**: Group by functionality (<500 per group)
