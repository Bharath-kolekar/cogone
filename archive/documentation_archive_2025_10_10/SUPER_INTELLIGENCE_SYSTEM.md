## Implementation Details

### Mood Detection Algorithm

```typescript
interface MoodState {
  primary: 'happy' | 'sad' | 'neutral' | 'excited' | 'stressed' | 'focused' | 'confused' | 'motivated'
  intensity: number // 0-1
  confidence: number // 0-1
  timestamp: number
  duration: number // seconds
}
```

The system analyzes multiple indicators:
- **Facial Expressions**: Smile, frown, neutral, surprise, anger detection
- **Voice Tone**: Pitch, volume, speed, stress analysis
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Click speed, scroll patterns, pause frequency, task completion, error rates
- **Contextual Factors**: Time of day, day of week, session duration, previous mood, task complexity

### UI Adaptation Engine

The system dynamically applies CSS classes and styles based on detected mood:

```css
:root {
  --mood-primary: #10B981;
  --mood-secondary: #F59E0B;
  --mood-accent: #EC4899;
  --mood-background: #F0FDF4;
  --mood-text: #064E3B;
}

.mood-adaptive {
  background-color: var(--mood-background);
  color: var(--mood-text);
}
```
