## **üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details**

### **Hierarchical Orchestration Integration**
```python
# Smarty added as specialized orchestrator level
class OrchestrationLevel(str, Enum):
    STRATEGIC = "strategic"      # Meta-level decisions and governance
    TACTICAL = "tactical"        # Service coordination and workflow
    EXECUTION = "execution"      # Multi-agent consensus and execution
    SMARTY = "smarty"            # Smart Coding AI specialized tasks  ‚úÖ NEW
    QUALITY = "quality"          # Validation and compliance
    OPERATIONS = "operations"    # Basic coordination and monitoring
```

### **Intelligent Task Detection**
```python
async def _is_smarty_task(self, task: OrchestrationTask) -> bool:
    """Determine if this task should be handled by Smarty"""
    
    # Check task type for code-related activities
    smarty_task_types = [
        "code_completion", "code_generation", "code_analysis", "code_review",
        "smart_coding", "inline_completion", "code_suggestion", "pattern_recognition",
        "codebase_memory", "photographic_memory", "cross_session_context",
        "code_validation", "code_optimization", "refactoring", "debugging"
    ]
    
    # Check requirements for code-related keywords
    # Check for programming language requirements
    # Return True if Smarty should handle this task
```

### **Smarty Execution Method**
```python
async def _execute_smarty_task(self, task: OrchestrationTask, smarty: SmartCodingAIOptimized):
    """Execute task using Smarty (Smart Coding AI)"""
    
    # Route to appropriate Smarty method based on task type
    if task.task_type == "code_completion":
        result = await smarty.get_completion(...)
    elif task.task_type == "code_generation":
        result = await smarty.generate_code(...)
    elif task.task_type == "codebase_memory":
        result = await smarty.memory_system.analyze_project(...)
    # ... more routing logic
    
    return {
        "success": True,
        "data": result,
        "smarty_features": {
            "photographic_memory": True,
            "cross_session_context": True,
            "pattern_recognition": True,
            "multi_language_support": True
        }
    }
```
