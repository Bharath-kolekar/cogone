## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Continuous Operation:**

```
Backend Starts
    ↓
Continuous Helper Starts (always active)
    ↓
Every 1 Hour:
    ├─ Health Check
    ├─ Bug Detection
    ├─ Categorization:
    │   ├─ LOW + 95% confidence → ✅ Auto-fix
    │   ├─ MEDIUM/HIGH → 📋 Notify
    │   └─ DNA systems → 🛡️ Protected
    ├─ Apply Fixes (max 5)
    └─ Log Results
    ↓
Repeat Forever (while backend runs)
```

## 🎯 **The 3-Tier Intelligence System**

### **Tier 1: Detection (Automatic - Every 2h)**
- **Full Diagnostic** scans all code
- Identifies issues using DNA systems
- Saves results to JSON
- **Purpose**: Find all problems

### **Tier 2: Auto-Fix (Automatic - Every 1h)**
- **Continuous Helper** fixes safe bugs
- Only LOW severity + high confidence
- Max 5 fixes per check
- **Purpose**: Handle routine maintenance

### **Tier 3: Human Review (On-Demand)**
- MEDIUM/HIGH severity bugs
- Low confidence fixes
- Critical changes
- **Purpose**: Handle complex issues

---

## 💡 **Real-World Example**

### **Hour 0: Bug Introduced**
```python
# Developer commits code
import sys, os, json, datetime  # Only json is used

def process(data):
    return json.dumps(data)
```

### **Hour 1: Detection**
```
🔄 Continuous Helper detects:
  - Bug: Unused imports (sys, os, datetime)
  - Severity: LOW
  - Confidence: 98%
  - File: service.py (NOT a DNA system)
```

### **Hour 1: Auto-Fix**
```
✅ Categorized as auto-fixable
✅ Immutable Foundation DNA checked: allowed
✅ Fix applied automatically
✅ Logged: "Auto-fixed unused imports"
```

### **Result:**
```python
# Code after auto-fix
import json

def process(data):
    return json.dumps(data)
```

**Developer wakes up**: Bug already fixed! ✅

---

## 🛡️ **DNA Protection Test**

### **Scenario: Helper Tries to Fix DNA System**

```python
Bug detected in reality_check_dna.py
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Confidence: 85%

Continuous Helper attempts fix...
  ↓
Immutable Foundation DNA intercepts:
  ❌ REJECTED!
  Reason: "You don't modify the ruler to fit the measurement"
  
Result:
  • Fix blocked ✅
  • Violation logged ✅
  • DNA system protected ✅
  • Notification created for human review 📋
```
