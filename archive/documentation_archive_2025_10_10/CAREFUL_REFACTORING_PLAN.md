# Careful Refactoring Plan

## Objective
Refactor large files incrementally with safety checks at each step.

## Target Files
1. **smart_coding_ai_optimized.py** (298.8 KB)
2. **ai_orchestration_layer.py** (283.2 KB)

## Safety-First Approach

### Phase 1: Preparation (BEFORE any refactoring)
- [x] Restore clean backup from cogone.zip
- [x] Verify backend imports successfully
- [ ] Create baseline import test
- [ ] Git commit clean state
- [ ] Create backup of current state

### Phase 2: Refactor ONE File at a Time

#### For Each File:

**Step 1: Analysis**
- Read the file to understand structure
- Identify natural boundaries (classes, major functions)
- Plan module structure

**Step 2: Create Tests**
- Create import test for the file
- Document all exports/imports
- Test current functionality

**Step 3: Extract ONE Module**
- Extract smallest logical unit (e.g., one class or related functions)
- Keep original file intact
- Create new module file

**Step 4: Update Imports**
- Add import to new module in original file
- Keep original class/function as re-export for compatibility
- No other files need updating yet

**Step 5: Verify**
- Test imports work: `python -c "from app.main import app"`
- Test server starts: `uvicorn app.main:app --timeout 5`
- If success → Git commit
- If failure → Revert immediately

**Step 6: Repeat**
- Extract next logical unit
- Follow steps 3-5

### Phase 3: Complete One File Before Moving to Next

Only after smart_coding_ai_optimized.py is fully refactored and stable:
- Move to ai_orchestration_layer.py
- Follow same careful process

## Key Safety Rules

1. **ONE change at a time** - Never extract multiple modules simultaneously
2. **Test after EVERY change** - Backend must import successfully
3. **Git commit after success** - Every successful extraction gets committed
4. **Immediate revert on failure** - Any error = immediate rollback
5. **Keep compatibility** - Original file re-exports everything
6. **No downstream changes** - Other files don't need updating during refactoring

## Success Criteria

After each extraction:
- ✅ Backend imports without errors
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ No import errors in any file
- ✅ Git committed

## Rollback Plan

If ANY step fails:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD  # Revert to last good commit
```

## Current Status
- Phase 1: In Progress
- Files refactored: 0
- Modules extracted: 0
