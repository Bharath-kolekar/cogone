### **Test Suite 3: Integration Tests (1/1 PASSED)**

#### Test 3.1: Validators Working Together
Tested with intentionally bad code containing:
- Security issues (eval, os.system)
- Performance issues (SELECT *)

**Results**:
- Factual errors: 3 detected ✅
- Security vulnerabilities: 2 detected ✅
- Performance issues: 2 detected ✅

**Result**: ✅ PASS - Validators detect multiple issues correctly
