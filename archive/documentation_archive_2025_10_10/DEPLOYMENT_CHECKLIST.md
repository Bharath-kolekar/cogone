## Resource Monitoring Setup

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Railway dashboard - Check credit usage
- [ ] Supabase dashboard - Check database size
- [ ] Upstash dashboard - Check Redis commands
- [ ] Groq console - Check API usage
- [ ] GitHub Actions - Check deployment status

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Clean up old data

### Monthly Reviews
- [ ] Verify still within free tier limits
- [ ] Review user growth
- [ ] Plan scaling if needed
- [ ] Update dependencies

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Deployment Successful When:
- ‚úÖ Backend responds to health checks
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads and is functional
- ‚úÖ Database queries work
- ‚úÖ Redis caching works
- ‚úÖ AI code generation works
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints accessible
- ‚úÖ CI/CD deploys automatically
- ‚úÖ Resource usage within free tier limits

### Cost Target:
- ‚úÖ **$0/month** for 100-500 users
- ‚úÖ **$0-5/month** for 500-1000 users
- ‚úÖ **$5-20/month** for 1000-5000 users

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If Railway credit runs out:
1. Switch to Render free tier (750 hours/month)
2. Or deploy to local server temporarily
3. Or upgrade Railway ($5/month for more credit)

### If Supabase storage full:
1. Archive old data
2. Compress logs
3. Or upgrade to Pro ($25/month for 8 GB)

### If Redis commands exceeded:
1. Increase memory cache usage
2. Reduce cache TTL
3. Or upgrade Upstash ($10/month for 100k commands)

### If Groq rate limited:
1. Fallback to Together AI
2. Fallback to local Ollama
3. Implement request queuing
