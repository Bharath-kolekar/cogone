# üß¨ **Consistency DNA System - CognOmega Core**

## **üéØ Overview**

The **Consistency DNA System** is the foundational architecture of CognOmega, ensuring **100% consistency** in all generated code, configurations, and system operations. This system is embedded into the core DNA of every AI component, making consistency an inherent property rather than an afterthought.

## **üîß Core DNA Features**

### **1. Automatic Consistency Validation**

Every piece of code generated by Smarty automatically undergoes:

- **Variable Naming Consistency**: Ensures consistent variable names across frontend/backend
- **Import Order Validation**: Validates proper import statement ordering
- **Function Signature Consistency**: Ensures async/await patterns for database operations
- **API Endpoint Validation**: Validates RESTful endpoint conventions
- **Configuration Consistency**: Validates proper typing and structure
- **Database Schema Validation**: Ensures consistent naming conventions
- **Error Handling Validation**: Validates proper error handling patterns

### **2. Auto-Fix Capabilities**

The system can automatically fix many consistency issues:

- **Variable Name Mapping**: `JWT_SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí `JWT_SECRET`
- **Redis URL Standardization**: `REDIS_URL` ‚Üí `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- **Import Ordering**: Reorders imports to standard library ‚Üí third party ‚Üí local
- **Frontend Variable Addition**: Automatically adds missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
- **Configuration Type Fixes**: Corrects type annotations

### **3. Real-time Monitoring**

Continuous monitoring of:

- **Variable Naming Consistency**: 100% threshold
- **API Endpoint Consistency**: 95% threshold
- **Database Schema Consistency**: 100% threshold
- **Frontend-Backend Sync**: 100% threshold
- **Configuration Consistency**: 100% threshold
- **Import Order Consistency**: 90% threshold
- **Error Handling Consistency**: 95% threshold

## **üìä Consistency Rules**

### **Critical Rules (Must be 100%)**

1. **JWT Secret Consistency**
   - Rule: `JWT_SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí `JWT_SECRET`
   - Impact: Authentication system failure if violated

2. **Redis URL Consistency**
   - Rule: `REDIS_URL` ‚Üí `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
   - Impact: Cache/Queue services failure if violated

3. **Frontend Variable Mapping**
   - Rule: Backend variables must have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for frontend
   - Impact: Frontend cannot connect to backend if violated

4. **Database Schema Consistency**
   - Rule: All database fields must use `snake_case`
   - Impact: Database operations failure if violated

### **High Priority Rules (95% threshold)**

1. **API Endpoint Consistency**
   - Rule: All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions
   - Pattern: `/api/v{version}/{resource}`

2. **Error Handling Consistency**
   - Rule: All critical functions must have proper error handling
   - Pattern: `try-except` blocks for database operations

3. **Function Signature Consistency**
   - Rule: Database operations must be `async`
   - Pattern: `async def create_*`, `async def update_*`, etc.

### **Medium Priority Rules (90% threshold)**

1. **Import Order Consistency**
   - Rule: Standard library ‚Üí Third party ‚Üí Local imports
   - Pattern: Proper import grouping and ordering

2. **Configuration Consistency**
   - Rule: All config variables must be properly typed
   - Pattern: `variable_name: type_annotation`

## **üîç Validation Process**

### **Code Generation Flow**

1. **Generate Initial Code**: Smarty generates code using AI models
2. **Consistency Validation**: Automatic validation against all rules
3. **Auto-fix Application**: Apply automatic fixes where possible
4. **Delivery Decision**: Only deliver code that meets consistency standards
5. **Monitoring Update**: Update real-time consistency metrics

### **Validation Levels**

- **Critical Issues**: Block code delivery entirely
- **High Issues**: Block delivery, require manual fix
- **Medium Issues**: Auto-fix and deliver with warning
- **Low Issues**: Auto-fix and deliver silently
