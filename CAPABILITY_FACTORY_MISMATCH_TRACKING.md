## Action Plan

### Step 1: Create Missing Classes (Production-Grade)
All removed classes need to be created as real implementations in their respective files.

### Step 2: Fix Router Import Errors
- `super_intelligent_optimizer.py`: Fix `get_database` import
- Any other import errors

### Step 3: Re-enable ALL 12 Routers
Uncomment and ensure all work

### Step 4: Verify Zero Degradation
- All capabilities work
- All routers accessible
- All endpoints functional

**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Fixing now with zero degradation
