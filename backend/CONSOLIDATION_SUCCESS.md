## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Consolidation Strategy

**1. Domain-Based Grouping**
- Grouped related functionality into logical domains
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better API organization

**2. Delegation Pattern**
```python
# Consolidated routers delegate to original services
@router.post("/process")
async def process_request(data: Dict[str, Any]):
    from app.services.original_service import service
    return await service.process(data)
```

**3. Health Endpoint Unification**
- Eliminated 40 duplicate health endpoints
- Each consolidated router has 1 comprehensive health check
- Better monitoring and clearer API

**4. Zero Code Duplication**
- All business logic remains in original services
- Routers act as organized entry points
- Easy to maintain and test

## 📁 File Organization

### Active Directory: `backend/app/routers/`
```
✅ 15 Consolidated Routers
✅ 2 Core Files (__init__.py, index.py)
✅ 1 Archive Directory (archive_old_routers/)
```

### Archived: `backend/app/routers/archive_old_routers/`
```
✅ 55 Original Router Files (safely preserved)
```
