## 🗑️ WHAT WAS IN REMOVED DIRECTORIES

### **Removed Directories (11 dirs):**

Each directory contained **ONLY placeholder files**:

**Example Structure:**
```
frontend/components/smart-coding-ai/
├── components.tsx      # Empty: "// TODO: Move components here"
├── hooks.ts           # Empty: "// TODO: Move hooks here"  
├── types.ts           # Empty: "// TODO: Move types here"
├── [main].tsx         # Empty: "// TODO: Copy logic here"
├── index.ts           # Just exports: "export * from './components'"
└── README.md          # Instructions: "TODO: Extract manually..."
```

**What These Files Contained:**
- ❌ NO actual code
- ❌ NO actual components
- ❌ NO actual hooks
- ❌ NO actual types
- ❌ NO functionality
- ✅ ONLY TODO comments
- ✅ ONLY placeholder structure
- ✅ ONLY instructions for manual work

**Total Content Example:**
```tsx
// components.tsx content:
// TODO: Move 5 components here
// Components found: Component1, Component2...

// That's it! Just a comment!
```

## ✅ WHAT WAS RESTORED

### **11 Original Files Restored from Quarantine:**

All files were copied back from quarantine:
- ✅ Full content restored
- ✅ All functionality intact
- ✅ All code preserved
- ✅ All features working

**Restoration Method:**
```python
shutil.copy2(backup_path, original_path)
# Copies file with all metadata preserved
```
