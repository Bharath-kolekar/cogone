# 🚨 PERMANENT REMINDER

## "PARALLELLY KEEP UPDATING THE DOCUMENTS"

This is a **CRITICAL, PERMANENT REMINDER** that must be followed for ALL development work.

### What This Means
Every time you make ANY change to the codebase, you MUST also update the relevant documentation files.

### Why This Matters
- 📚 **Knowledge Preservation**: Keeps team knowledge current and accessible
- 🚀 **Onboarding**: New team members can understand the system quickly
- 🔧 **Maintenance**: Easier debugging and system maintenance
- 📈 **Productivity**: Reduces time spent figuring out how things work
- 🎯 **Quality**: Ensures consistent, high-quality documentation

### Documentation Files That Must Be Updated
- `PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` - Project overview and status
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API endpoints and schemas
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment procedures
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Development processes
- `BUILD_FIXES.md` - Build and dependency issues
- `TRPC_ISSUE_TRACKER.md` - Specific issue tracking
- `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md` - Documentation protocols
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Performance optimization guide
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` - Mandatory performance optimization workflow
- Any feature-specific documentation

### When to Update Documentation
- ✅ **New Features** → Update feature documentation
- ✅ **Bug Fixes** → Update troubleshooting sections
- ✅ **API Changes** → Update API documentation
- ✅ **Database Changes** → Update schema documentation
- ✅ **Configuration Changes** → Update environment docs
- ✅ **Deployment Changes** → Update deployment guides
- ✅ **Process Changes** → Update workflow documentation
- ✅ **Performance Issues** → Follow PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PROTOCOL.md
- ✅ **Performance Optimizations** → Update performance documentation

### How to Remember
1. **Make it part of your workflow** - Documentation is not an afterthought
2. **Update docs as you code** - Don't wait until the end
3. **Use checklists** - See `DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE.md`
4. **Review with team** - Include docs in code reviews
5. **Set reminders** - Use tools to remind you

### Consequences of Not Following This Rule
- ❌ Outdated documentation becomes useless
- ❌ Team productivity decreases
- ❌ Knowledge is lost when people leave
- ❌ Onboarding new team members becomes difficult
- ❌ Debugging and maintenance becomes harder
- ❌ Project quality suffers

### This Reminder Should Be:
- 🔄 **Included in every development workflow**
- 📝 **Added to all pull request templates**
- 🗣️ **Mentioned in all team meetings**
- 👀 **Part of every code review checklist**
- 🎓 **Included in onboarding processes**
- 📋 **Added to all project templates**

## Quick Reference

### Before Making Any Code Change, Ask:
1. "What documentation will this change affect?"
2. "Do I need to update API docs?"
3. "Do I need to update deployment procedures?"
4. "Do I need to update troubleshooting guides?"
5. "Do I need to update project status?"

### After Making Any Code Change, Verify:
1. ✅ All relevant documentation files updated
2. ✅ Code examples in docs still work
3. ✅ Links and references are correct
4. ✅ Version numbers are updated
5. ✅ Last updated dates are modified

## 🚨 REMEMBER: "PARALLELLY KEEP UPDATING THE DOCUMENTS"

This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is a **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT** for all development work.

**Good documentation is essential for project success and team productivity.**
